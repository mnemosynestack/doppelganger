# UI Tour

Doppelganger's user interface is designed for simplicity and power. It consists of four main sections: **Dashboard**, **Editor**, **Captures**, and **Settings**.

## 1. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
*   **Overview**: View all your saved automation tasks in a grid layout.
*   **Actions**:
    *   **Create Task**: Click `+ New Task` to start a blank automation flow.
    *   **Import/Export**: Use the `Import` and `Export` buttons to move tasks between environments (JSON format).
    *   **Edit**: Click any task card to open the editor.
    *   **Delete**: Remove tasks permanently.
*   **Status Indicators**: Shows the task mode (Agent, Scraper, Headful) and target URL.

## 2. Editor (`/tasks/:id`)
The core of Doppelganger. This screen is split into two panes:
*   **Left Pane (Configuration)**:
    *   **Task Name**: Rename your task.
    *   **Mode Selector**: Switch between `Agent` (block-based), `Scraper` (simple extraction), and `Headful` (interactive).
    *   **View Mode**: Toggle between `Visual` (blocks), `JSON` (raw code), and `API` (integration details).
    *   **Target URL**: The starting point for the automation.
    *   **Actions List**: Drag-and-drop list of steps (Click, Type, Wait, etc.).
    *   **Variables**: Define dynamic parameters (e.g., `{$query}`) for reuse.
    *   **Extraction Script**: Write JavaScript to parse the page content after execution.
    *   **Settings**: Configure stealth, recording, proxy rotation, and viewports.
*   **Right Pane (Results)**:
    *   **Live Logs**: Real-time feedback from the runner.
    *   **Screenshot Preview**: See the final state of the browser.
    *   **Extracted Data**: View the JSON/CSV output.
    *   **History**: Access previous versions of the task (if saved).

## 3. Captures (`/captures`)
A gallery of all artifacts generated by your tasks.
*   **Screenshots**: View full-page or viewport captures.
*   **Recordings**: Watch video playbacks of the entire automation session (if enabled).
*   **Management**: Delete old captures to free up space.

## 4. Settings (`/settings`)
Global configuration for the Doppelganger instance.
*   **System**:
    *   **API Key**: Generate or revoke your API key for remote execution.
    *   **User Agent**: Set a global User-Agent string or let Doppelganger rotate them.
    *   **Storage**: Clear all captures or cookies.
*   **Data**: Manage persistent cookies and specific capture files.
*   **Proxies**:
    *   **Add Proxy**: Input HTTP/SOCKS proxies.
    *   **Import**: Bulk add proxies from a list.
    *   **Rotation**: Configure rotation strategy (Round-Robin vs Random) and whether to include your local IP.
