## 2026-05-23 - Actionable Empty State
**Learning:** Empty states (e.g., "No Tasks Found") should not just be informative or decorative; they are a prime opportunity to guide the user to their first success. A static, low-contrast empty state feels like a dead end.
**Action:** Always include a primary call-to-action button (e.g., "Create First Task") directly within the empty state component to reduce friction and encourage engagement. Ensure the empty state has sufficient contrast to be readable.
