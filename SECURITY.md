# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, send an email to `security@doppelgangerdev.com` with:
- the npm or container version and tag you were using
- a description of the issue and how to reproduce it
- any relevant logs or screenshots

We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours, work with you privately, and post a public advisory only after a fix is ready.

## Supported Versions
We consider the `main` branch the supported release train. Please verify against that branch with your reproduction steps.

## Response Process
We strive to provide a fix or mitigation instructions within three business days. If a fix takes longer, we will keep you updated on progress and ETA.
